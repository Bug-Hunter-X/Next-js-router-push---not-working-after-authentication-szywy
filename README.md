# Next.js router.push() not working after authentication

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js applications where `router.push()` fails to navigate to a protected page after successful authentication.  The problem often stems from client-side routing inconsistencies or improper authentication handling.  The solution involves leveraging the `router.replace()` method and ensuring appropriate authentication state management.

## Bug

The provided `bug.js` file showcases a Next.js component using `router.push()` to redirect to `/my-page`, which requires authentication. In many cases this will result in the route not navigating correctly, or errors in the console.  The issue lies in how Next.js handles client-side routing and potential authentication checks that are not correctly coordinated.

## Solution

The solution, provided in `bugSolution.js`, addresses this problem by implementing better authentication state management and utilizing `router.replace()`. This is often a better choice than `router.push()` when you don't want the user to be able to use the back button to return to the previous page.

This approach ensures a smoother user experience and addresses potential routing inconsistencies related to authentication.
